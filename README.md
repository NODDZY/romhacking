# Romhacking

This is a repository for miscellaneous romhacks. Folders are named after the CRC32 value of the base ROMs.

Apply the patches using any ROM patcher, like the one found at [romhacking.net](https://www.romhacking.net/patch/). For a more detailed explanation see [the emulation wiki](https://emulation.gametechwiki.com/index.php/Apply_ROM_hacks_and_translations). The base ROMs should match the [No-Intro](https://no-intro.org/) database.
